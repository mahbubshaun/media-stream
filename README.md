## About The Project

This mobile app, developed with React Native, integrates the LibVLC SDK for seamless media streaming from remote servers, offering users a rich viewing experience. It features a dynamic recommendation system powered by the TMDB API, showcasing trending, popular, and top-rated movies, alongside a diverse genre selection. Users can rate movies, add them to personalized watchlists, and stream content directly if available on their personal servers. Additionally, the app includes a mini-browser for server interaction and media file streaming, enhancing functionality and user engagement. With its focus on intuitive design and user-centric features, the app aims to provide a comprehensive media discovery and streaming solution.
